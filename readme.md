# **Cloud-Hut**

**Cloud-Hut** is a tool that sets up your machine for hosting projects and exposing them to the internet, similar to how you would configure a DigitalOcean droplet. With Cloud-Hut, you can easily turn your local computer into a ready-to-use server for hosting applications, websites, or other services, without needing to rent cloud infrastructure.

---

## **Features**

* Quickly configure your local machine for hosting web projects.
* Set up reverse proxies, firewalls, and other essential services.
* Expose your projects to the internet securely.
* Mimics the setup of a DigitalOcean droplet, making it easier to deploy applications locally.

---

## **Installation**

### **Option 1: Install via curl (Recommended)**

1. **Run the following command** to download and install Cloud-Hut on your system:

   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/victoredet/cloud-hut/Oak/install.sh | sudo bash
   ```

2. The script will:

   * Download the appropriate binary for your system (Linux/macOS/Windows).
   * Set up necessary configurations to expose your local machine to the internet.
   * Add an alias (`cloud-hut`) to your shell configuration, so you can easily run the tool.

3. After the installation, you can use the `cloud-hut` command to configure your machine.

## **Usage**

### **Basic Usage**

Once installed, you can use `cloud-hut` from the command line. Here's an example of how to use it:

1. **Run the setup**:

   ```bash
   cloud-hut setup
   ```

   This will configure your machine with the necessary tools and settings for hosting projects.

2. **Expose your local project to the internet**:

   If you're running a web application on your local machine, you can use Cloud-Hut to make it publicly accessible:

   ```bash
   cloud-hut expose --port 8080 --name my-web-app
   ```

   This will create a secure tunnel from your local machine to the internet, allowing external users to access your project via a public URL.

---

## **Configuration**

Cloud-Hut automatically sets up essential services like:

* Reverse Proxy: For routing traffic to your web applications.
* Firewall Configuration: To secure your local machine while exposing services.
* SSL Certificates: Automatically generate and configure HTTPS for your applications.

If you need to customize any of the configuration options, such as changing the ports or domains, you can modify the configuration files located at `~/.cloud-hut/config.json`.
